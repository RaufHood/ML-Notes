# Machine Learning
Basics

## Model types
- Logisitc Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XG Boost
- Neural Network

## Supervised Learning
Training set and valeidation set
labels are ground thruth data used to train a model
3 Types: regression, calssification (binary and multyclass) and ranking.

Models have features and ground truth data and try to make a prediction
## Unsupervised Learning

## ML model steps
### Data Splitting
Have training (used to train the model), validation (used for hyperparameter tuning and performance increade) and test (used at the very end) datasets. For example 60, 20, 20 split.
For a fair evaluation of the model and remove chances.  

### Model training

### Model validation

### Model Evaluation/selection
Once model selected you can combine the training + validation set and train it once more.

### Test the model
