# Machine Learning
These are my personal notes on ML to use as a refresher of the core principles.  
This is a work in progress and imporvement suggestions are very welcome. Let's go!

## Supervised Learning
Training set and valeidation set
labels are ground thruth data used to train a model
3 Types: regression, calssification (binary and multyclass) and ranking.
ML models are trained using features (extracted from training data) and ground truth data (labels). 
The training process consists of fitting a function to the training data to predict the desired outcome, and generalize to new unseen data.

## Unsupervised Learning

## Self Supervised Learning

## ML model steps
### Data Splitting
Have training (used to train the model), validation (used for hyperparameter tuning and performance increade) and test (used at the very end) datasets. For example 60, 20, 20 split.
For a fair evaluation of the model and remove chances.  

### Model training

### Model validation

### Model Evaluation/selection
Once model selected you can combine the training + validation set and train it once more.

### Test the model



## Model types
- Logisitc Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XG Boost
- Neural Network
